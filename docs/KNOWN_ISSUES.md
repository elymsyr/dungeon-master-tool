# Known Issues

Living list of what is deferred, broken-on-purpose, or a real bug still being tracked.
**This file is the source of truth** — the `### Known issues` section of each release note
in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) is filled in from here at release time (copy the
items that are still open on the release date; do not edit past releases afterwards).

**Last reviewed:** September 2026 (v15.1.1)

## Open

_None tracked right now._

## Resolved

- **Bundled world references stayed soft** — Fixed: species and class on an imported player
  character now resolve to the installed entity, so the sheet shows the live card's name
  and the lineage (subspecies) picker appears for these characters too. A reference to
  content that is not installed still falls back to the recorded name, by design.
- **Portraits are not carried over when you create an account** — Characters created
  before signing up keep their data but lose their portrait images after the account is
  created; re-attach the image manually.
- **Deleting a world bricked its characters** — Fixed: world deletion now actually clears
  the characters' world link, so they survive as ordinary characters and open normally.
  A character still pointing at a world that is gone repairs itself the next time it is
  opened.
- **Signed-out users could get stuck on a claimed character** — Fixed with the item above:
  once the dead world link is cleared, the character opens and can be released or deleted
  again.
- **Marketplace downloads failed on release builds** — Fixed in v15.1.1: the asset server
  address now has a built-in default instead of depending on a build-time setting, so
  release builds no longer list content they cannot download.
- **Marketplace never showed banner images** — Fixed in v15.1.1, same cause as above.
- **Drow 120 ft superior darkvision** — Fixed: the resolver keeps the largest granted range
  per sense, so Superior Darkvision 120 correctly beats the base 60.
